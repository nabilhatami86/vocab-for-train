      'My name is Maisara, but I would like to be called Sara. I am 29 years old and a married woman. I am the second child and the only girl among my 3 brothers in my nuclear family. I am very close to my parents and all of my siblings, especially my youngest brother since he lived with me and my husband.',
      'I think my family tree is unique because I have a cross-cultural extended family. I have uncles and aunts (from my father\'s side) with different religious beliefs and cultures which are Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and Pagan. Therefore, we always have a great time gathering together especially when it comes to festivals and celebration days such as Eid Al-Fitr, Christmas, Chinese New Year, Diwali, and wedding ceremonies as well. This is a common situation in my country, especially in my home town.',
      'I live in Malaysia which has two regions; Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo (also known as East Malaysia) and they\'re separated by the South China Sea. I live in Sabah, which is located in Borneo. In my country, Sabah is also known as \'A Land below the Wind\'. We have several mountains along with green mountain ranges and natural life. We also have lots of beautiful islands and white sandy beaches along our coast. It\'s the right destination for those who love snorkeling or scuba diving.',
      'I also love to watch movies, listen to music, or visit my sibling\'s house in my spare time. Other than that, I love to travel as well. My husband and I always spend our holidays going to new places, whether it\'s in our country or abroad.',
      'I took Psychology Counselling while I was at University. After I graduated, I have been working as a Counsellor in Juvenile Centre, which is under Social Welfare Department, for about 5 years.

All these experiences are useful to me and make me realize that I should be grateful for having a nice and loving family.',
      'However, sometimes I\'ve had a hard time since there are a lot of challenges as well. But even so, I\'ve tried to look on the positive side, because I know that dealing with humans isn\'t an easy thing. To improve my work performance and myself, I believe there are still many things I have to learn, and need to strive for having a better life in the future.',

      'Our interests keep changing from time to time. Our favorite color, favorite food, favorite person, or favorite game, everything changes as we grow up and our favorite subject is no exception. Many students love certain subjects in their primary classes, but then completely change as they begin to learn other subjects. My experience has been quite similar. I have also had a shift in interest and my favorite subject has changed with time.',
      'I had been a big fan of mathematics from the time numbers were introduced to me in a nursery. While my teacher had taught numbers up to 10, I learned to count up to 50 with the help of my mother. I was so curious and keen on learning this subject that I soon began learning addition. My mother introduced fun ways of learning addition through the use of different things such as spoons, oranges, and soft toys. I also learned subtraction using such innovative methods.',
      'Looking at my interest in the subject, my mother soon made me join an abacus class. I also accompanied her to the toy shop to get an abacus for me. I simply loved doing calculations using this ancient method of learning mathematics. Joining the course helped me to enhance my knowledge about the subject. It laid a strong base for me and I performed extremely well in the subject. I scored high in mathematics. Most of the time, I got full marks in it.',
      'I used to practice solving mathematics problems. Whenever I was asked to study, I opened my mathematics book and began solving them. I solved mathematics Olympiad problems with a good score. I also joined quite a few inter-school mathematics competitions. Many of my classmates came to me to seek help in the subject. Many still come to me to learn different topics. I help them with the subject whenever they need any kind of assistance.',
      'Then, I changed my interest to French ever since I entered sixth grade. We had an option of choosing between Sanskrit and French as a third subject in this grade and I decided to go for French. While my parents insisted that I should take up Sanskrit as my mother is well versed in the subject and could help me with it, I convinced them otherwise. Although they did not like the idea initially, they realized I took the right decision after I started scoring high in the subject. I was always keen on learning foreign languages. It was something new, fresh, and interesting.',
      'My interest in the subject keeps me glued to it. Besides, since I took it up against the wish of my parents, I learn it with all the more zeal to prove them wrong and my decision was right. My French teacher is quite helpful and supportive. Her method of teaching is quite innovative. She makes us understand this new language easily. She has made learning so much fun and interesting. I always look forward to the French class. My friends and I also try to use the sentences we have learned as we converse with each other. I have also started following French artists and listening to French songs.',

Everyone in our family, extended family, and neighborhood talk highly about him because of his extremely friendly and helpful nature. People come to him to look for advice as well as for help as they know he has the solution for every problem.',

I still remember the incident when one of my father\'s colleagues fell seriously ill, my father supported his family wholeheartedly. His colleague\'s family was not financially well off. My father\'s colleague was the only member of the family that made money. His parents and wife were not only financially dependent on him but also did not know how to deal with the hospital administration and other stuff. My father helped them during their hour of need. He used to spend hours in the hospital helping his colleague\'s family with the hospital administration. He also tried to help with his colleague\'s medical expenses. He contributed whatever he could and requested his other office colleagues to support their one colleague who is in need. He became an inspiration for others. Many of his colleagues came forward to contribute to the treatment. Soon, the funds were met and the treatment was completed. I remember the day when that colleague and his family visited our family after his recovery and thanked my father with all their heart. This incident has left a mark on my heart. I feel proud of my father whenever I think of it.',

He won several awards during his school and college days and this inspires me to work hard and earn appreciation too. Even in his office, he has won the employee of the year award, the most hard-working team member award, and many other accreditations. I have seen him working for hours whenever his work demands. At times, he even works on holidays. However, this does not mean that he ignores his family and gives priority to his work. He knows how to maintain a work-life balance and we love this thing about him.',

He also takes us out regularly. Besides, he helps my mother with small household tasks to share her load.',
      'My father is very clear about the fact that family comes first. So, even though he is always ready to help others and is extremely dedicated to his office work, he does not ignore us in the event. He involves us in many of his tasks instead of leaving us behind waiting for him. This helps in two ways. We stay close to him and also learn from his good deeds.',

    title: 'Are You Naughty Or Nice? Personality Traits Linked To Genetics, Social Environment',
    subtitle: 'Personality traits: genetics vs social environment',
    overview: 'Materi reading ilmiah populer tentang pengaruh genetik dan lingkungan sosial terhadap sifat dan perilaku manusia.',
    passage: [
      'Many of us tend to look at personality traits as either black or white: good or bad, naughty or nice, sweet or sour. However, shades of grey exist when it comes to the origin of these traits. According to a study published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology, some of us are naturally generous and others are less so, due to not only our genetics but also our social environment.',
      'Past research has produced the theory of kin selection, the evolutionary strategy by which animals give up their reproductive success for the benefit of their community. Worker bees, for example, will give up their lives to promote the welfare of the queen bee and they will even commit suicidal attacks on intruders. These behaviors are influenced by genetic polymorphism or gene variations that lead to different types of members within a population. So, in other words, it\'s hard-wired within the bees to be altruistic toward their relatives. In the current study, researchers wanted to see how much of a role genetic polymorphism plays in social interactions. Is it the environment or the genes that make us naughty or nice?',
      'Along with a team of international colleagues, Dr. Sasha Dall, a senior lecturer of mathematical ecology at the University of Exeter in England, sought to develop a mathematical framework that would help to examine social behavior in a range of different species to help explain the evolution of these habits. The research team looked at the genes and social interactions that occurred within colonies of microbes to explore why some of us are generous by nature while others aren\'t. This microbial model of social evolution allowed them to gain a better understanding of how much kindness is influenced by genetics versus the people around us.',
      'The findings revealed that our social behavior is often determined by a set of "inherited genetic tendencies" that can predict the trajectory of our relationships. Moreover, it was not just the environment and the experiences that predicted how closely we relate to our communities, but also these genetic variations. This is a departure from common belief, which suggests that the knowledge we gain from world events influences our responses and how we act in the future.',
      'In a statement, however, Dall suggested that DNA influences social behavior more than we think. "Some species rely on inherited instructions on what to do," she said. "Individuals behave differently according to which specific genetic variants they are born with." In other words, our ability to be kind or to be someone rude is inherited — someone who is rude will most likely remain rude even if they are talking to someone kind.',
      'In a similar 2011 study, researchers explored the possible links between genetics and so-called "prosocial" behavior — selfless acts that benefit others. In 46 people, they identified three inherited genetic makeups related to social behavior, GG, AG, and AA, to determine how they relate to social behavior. Those with a GG genotype were more likely to be prosocial, they found, while those with AG or AA were less likely to show compassion or parental sensitivity. They also experienced fewer positive emotions. These findings were confirmed after an experiment showed others perceived those with GG genotypes as more caring, trustworthy, and kind.',
      'GG genotypes make a person more caring because they\'re linked to the body\'s oxytocin receptors, the 2011 study found. Also known as the "love hormone," oxytocin promotes trust, love, and social behavior, thus partially explaining why people with these genes are more likely to be kind and interact well with others.',
      'That said, the current study found genes only have some influence on how we act. If we\'re born without the GG genotype, it doesn\'t mean we\'re destined to be apathetic and rude — our environment also plays a part.',

    title: 'Why Hobbies Are Important',
    subtitle: 'Benefits of hobbies for life and learning',
    overview: 'Materi reading tentang manfaat hobi: stress relief, skill growth, social bonding, confidence, dan knowledge.',
    passage: [
      'Having a hobby that we enjoy brings us joy and enriches our lives. It gives us something fun to do during our leisure time and allows us to learn new skills. We are very fortunate to have so many different options out there today. There are entire websites devoted to hobbies and interests.',
      'There are many reasons why all of us should have at least one hobby, but here are the main advantages: 1. It makes you more interesting. People who have hobbies have experiences and stories that they can share with others. They also have specialized knowledge that they can teach to anyone who also has an interest in the same topics as they do. 2. It helps to relieve stress by keeping you engaged in something you enjoy. Hobbies give you a way to take your mind off the stresses of everyday life. They let you relax and seek pleasure in activities that are not associated with work, chores, or other responsibilities. 3. Hobbies help you become more patient. To develop a new hobby, you have to learn how to do something that is brand new to you. The odds are there will be a learning curve, and you will need to be patient to build your skills. 4. Having a hobby can help your social life and create a bond with others. A hobby is something that you can frequently enjoy with other people. Whether you join a club, play in a league, or just give others the fruits of your labor, a hobby is a great way to meet and get closer to people who have the same interests as you do. 5. It increases your confidence and self-esteem. The odds are that if you enjoy an activity, you are usually pretty good at it. Any activity in that you can excel is an opportunity for you to build your confidence and develop pride in your accomplishments. 6. It helps develop new skills. A hobby that you dedicate your time to will lead you to build new skills. As you spend more time on your hobby you will become better and better at it. 7. It increases your knowledge. Along with building new skills, you will also gain new knowledge through the development of your hobby.',
      'In case you are wondering what my hobbies are: Over the years, I have had numerous hobbies and interests, but I currently have 3 that I am passionate about. They have positively changed my life and provided me with a lot of joy.',
      'Reading — I love reading books, especially nonfiction ones. I currently read about 60 books per year on a wide array of topics. For example, I am currently reading a book called The Unconquered: In Search of the Amazon\'s Last Uncontacted Tribes which focuses on a tribe of native Indians that live in isolation in the Amazonian forest. The book is over 800 pages long and offers a fascinating glimpse into their lives and culture. It illustrates the importance of preserving our environment and ecology and is a wonderful read. Every book that I read teaches me something about the world at large and provides me with a new perspective on life. The books are a wonderful way to transport me to a different place and era without actually leaving home. Best of all, I joined my local public library and downloaded ebooks for free!',
      'Cooking — One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. On average, I cook about 5 days per week and often make extra food. Cooking has taught me so much about patience and focus because those 2 are essential ingredients to making delicious food. The more I cook, the better I get at it. Of course, I have also cooked food that did not turn out so well, but I learned from my mistakes and improved each time. I cook food that is healthy and that I enjoy eating. Best of all, it is generally cheaper and has better taste than eating out at most restaurants.',
      'Gardening — Edible gardens have become popular in the last couple of years. I started growing my first edible garden several years ago to complement my love for cooking. Not only does my garden provide me with herbs and vegetables that I can use in my favorite dishes, but it also provides me with a healthy and organic food source. I love knowing exactly what has gone into growing the food that I am eating. Additionally, I have learned a lot about what plants grow best in my region, what the best seasons are to grow each of them, and also how much water and sun they need. My edible garden not only nourishes my body but teaches me a lot as well.',
      'My hobbies are a very important part of my life. I find them to sweeten my days and give me a great escape from the regular stresses of life. If you have not already done so, I highly recommend that you start to explore and develop at least one hobby that you enjoy. I guarantee you will be very glad you did.',

    passage: [
      'Indonesia, with its countless and diverse natural, cultural, and historical charms, has been a tourist magnet for decades. Planning your way around this huge archipelago can make or break your overall travel experience. From flights to a local public car, We discover how to navigate public transport in Indonesia.',
      '1. Domestic flight — A sprawling archipelago with five main islands and 17,000 other smaller ones, the most effective and time-efficient way to travel within the country is via domestic flight. Most of the bigger cities like Bali, Lombok, Jakarta, Surabaya, Yogyakarta, and more, have their international airports while smaller towns may only operate domestic flights. Either way, you can conveniently navigate through most of Indonesia\'s many islands and cities by plane.',
      '2. Bus — Most cities in Indonesia have inter-city bus operators that employ short and long-distance travel buses daily. If you want to take your time traveling through cities and islands in Indonesia, getting around by bus may be more cost-effective depending on the destination. The journey can be long and tedious depending on your travel plans and the distance of your destination, but you can enjoy the marvelous views of nature and towns along the way.',
      '3. Train — Indonesia runs a pretty reliable railway service that goes across Java and Sumatra. You can count on the train line to travel short trips like Jakarta-Bandung and longer distances such as Jakarta-Yogyakarta. There are several options for class of travel, from economy to executive class. If you don\'t mind paying more, the executive class offers a much more convenient trip especially for longer distances, although even the economy class is now air-conditioned, only with less personal space for seating.',
      '4. Ferry and boats — Being the planet\'s largest archipelago, sea travel is a real necessity when traveling or living in Indonesia. People move around from one island to another, big or small, with the help of boat operators. The state-run ferry operator is quite reliable, although sadly many companies still employ old and dingy boats.',
      '5. Minivan bus — Minivan bus or angkot runs through most Indonesian cities and towns, big or small. These are non-air-conditioned minivans crafted to fit up to 12 people per vehicle. And while these may not be the most comfortable way to travel the town, fares are cheap and you can conveniently hail or tell the driver to stop anywhere you want within the route, as there are no designated stops for this transportation. Just yell \'Kiri\' or simply say \'stop\' wherever and the driver will drop you off.',
      '6. Travel apps — Online ride-hailing services can only get you so far but it\'s still one of the most hassle-free ways to go places, especially when you do not know your way around. Go-Jek, the local ride-hailing app, and Grab are the most used and reliable travel apps to use while traveling in Indonesia.',
