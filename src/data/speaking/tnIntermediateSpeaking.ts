          '   "I have known about this job since I was a child because my uncle is a doctor at a public hospital in my city. I used to visit him at the hospital and I was always amazed by how he took care of the patients with so much patience and dedication. Apart from that, I have also learned about this profession from television programmes and health-related books."',
          "── Point 3: What type of people do this job ──",
          '   "In my opinion, people who become doctors are usually very hardworking, disciplined, and compassionate individuals. They need to be patient because they deal with sick people every day, and they must be detail-oriented since a small mistake can have serious consequences. Most doctors spend many years studying at university and continue learning throughout their career to keep up with the latest medical knowledge."',
          "── Point 4: Why this job is useful to society ──",
          '   "I strongly believe that doctors are one of the most important and useful members of society. Without doctors, people would have no one to turn to when they are seriously ill. Doctors save lives every single day, whether it is treating a child with a fever or performing a complex surgery. They also play a key role in preventing diseases by educating the public about healthy lifestyles and vaccinations. On a larger scale, doctors helped the world fight against dangerous pandemics like COVID-19, which showed us just how essential this profession truly is. That is why I think being a doctor is not only a great career but also a noble contribution to humanity."',
